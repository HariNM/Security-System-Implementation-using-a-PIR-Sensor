# Security System Using LPC 1768 Microcontroller and a PIR Sensor

This repository contains the code and documentation for a security system implemented using an LPC 1768 microcontroller, incorporating a PIR sensor (HC-SR501 PIR Sensor), 4x4 keyboard interface, 16 x 2 LCD display interface, stepper motor, and buzzer for access control.

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a robust security mechanism that detects motion using the PIR sensor. Upon motion detection, the system prompts the user to input a password through the 4x4 keyboard. Correct authentication triggers the stepper motor to rotate in clockwise direction, indicating authorized access, while incorrect attempts activate the buzzer.

## Features

- Motion detection using Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor
- Password-based access control via keyboard interface
- Stepper motor activation for authorized access
- LCD Display for better user experience
- Buzzer alert for unauthorized attempts
- Developed on the Keil ÂµVision IDE and debugger using C/C++ programming language
- Downloaded the code into the LPC 1768 Microcontroller using Flash Magic.
